# Framework for the Analysis of Photographic Archival Data of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz

## Introduction
This framework is designed to help scholars analyze the collection data from the [Photothek](https://www.khi.fi.it/en/photothek/index.php), the photographic archive of the [Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz (KHI)](https://www.khi.fi.it/en/index.php). The Photothek houses over 630,000 photographs, with a significant part already digitized and available on the [Digital Photothek](https://photothek.khi.fi.it/) website.

The framework is available as a Jupyter Notebook, an interactive tool where you can directly execute your analyses. You can launch the notebook using Binder:

## Features
### What is this framework?
This framework includes tools for analyzing and visualizing photographic archival data. It is designed to be user-friendly, even for those with limited programming experience.
### Who can use this framework?
This framework is for scholars, researchers, and anyone interested in analyzing the Photothek's collections. It's especially helpful for users with little or no programming knowledge.
### What is Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter Notebook is a web app that lets you create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and text. It's popular in data science and research.
### Why Use Binder?
Binder is an online platform that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks in your web browser without needing to install any software. It's a convenient tool for users who want to analyze data interactively.
### What kind of data can I analyse?
You can analyze your own Photothek datasets if you have requested and obtained them from the KHI, or you can use the provided test datasets. The datasets should be in XML format.
### Is it compatible with my device?
Yes, the framework is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can also access it through web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. However, it's recommended to run the framework on a PC rather than a mobile device.
## Usage
