# Framework for the Analysis of Photographic Archival Data of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz

## Introduction
This framework is designed to support scholars in the quantitative analysis of collection data of the [Photothek](https://www.khi.fi.it/en/photothek/index.php) of the [Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz (KHI)](https://www.khi.fi.it/en/index.php). The Photothek currently houses a collection of over 630,000 photographs. The digitalization process of the collections is in progress, with a consistent part of the collections already available on the [Digital Photothek](https://photothek.khi.fi.it/) website.
The framework is available as a Jupyter Notebook, an interactive platform where you can directly execute your analyses. You can click this button to launch the notebook:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlessandraFa/photo-archive-data-analysis-framework.git/HEAD?labpath=Photo_Data_Analysis_KHI.ipynb)
